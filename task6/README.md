# Password Strength Evaluation

## Objective

The objective of this task is to understand what makes a password strong, test various passwords using an online password strength checker, analyze the results, and learn best practices for password creation and security.

## Tools Used

- **Password Strength Checker:** [PasswordMonster.com](https://www.passwordmonster.com)

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Creating Passwords of Varying Complexity

To evaluate password strength, I created five different passwords with increasing complexity:

| Password                | Type/Complexity         |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| password123             | Simple, common         |
| Password2025            | Slightly complex       |
| P@ssw0rd!2025           | Complex with symbols   |
| G#7dK!p2@Xz9Qw8L        | Very strong, random    |
| Blue!Sky$Runs4Fast      | Strong passphrase      |

---

### 2. Testing Passwords on PasswordMonster.com

Each password was tested on [PasswordMonster.com](https://www.passwordmonster.com). I entered each password, observed the strength rating, and recorded any feedback or suggestions provided by the tool.

### 3. Results and Feedback Table

| Password             | Strength      | Tool Feedback / Analysis                                  |
|----------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| password123          | Very Weak    | Too common, lacks symbols and uppercase, short length     |
| Password2025         | Very Weak    | Lacks symbols, predictable pattern, not enough complexity |
| P@ssw0rd!2025        | Medium       | Includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols           |
| G#7dK!p2@Xz9Qw8L     | Very Strong  | Excellent length, high randomness, strong symbol use      |
| Blue!Sky$Runs4Fast   | Very Strong  | Good length, mix of cases, symbols, resembles passphrase  |

### 4. Analysis and Best Practices

#### What Makes a Password Strong? (as per PasswordMonster)

- **Length:** Longer passwords are exponentially harder to crack. PasswordMonster recommends a minimum of 14 characters.
- **Complexity:** Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.
- **Randomness:** Avoid dictionary words, common phrases, or predictable patterns. PasswordMonster checks for common substitutions (like "E" to "3" or "A" to "@") and warns that these are easily guessed by hackers.
- **Uniqueness:** Use a different password for each account or service.
- **Passphrases:** Longer, memorable phrases with spaces and punctuation are more secure than short, complex passwords.

#### Best Practices Identified

- Avoid using personal information (e.g., names, birthdays).
- Do not reuse passwords across multiple sites.
- Do not store passwords in notes, spreadsheets, or browsers.
- Use password managers to generate and store complex passwords securely.
- Consider using passphrases for both strength and ease of recall.
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) whenever possible.

### 5. Common Password Attacks (Research Summary)

- **Brute Force Attack:** Tries every possible combination until the correct password is found. Longer and more complex passwords make this attack impractical.
- **Dictionary Attack:** Uses a list of common words and phrases to guess passwords. Avoiding dictionary words and using symbols/numbers helps defend against this.
- **Phishing:** Tricks users into revealing their passwords via fake websites or emails.
- **Credential Stuffing:** Uses leaked passwords from other breaches to access accounts elsewhere.

### 6. How Password Complexity Affects Security

Password complexity and length directly impact how resistant a password is to attacks. PasswordMonster emphasizes that every additional character in your password exponentially increases the time required to crack it. Simple substitutions (like "E" to "3") are not enough—true strength comes from length, unpredictability, and variety.

### 7. Creating and Evaluating a Strong Password

**Example Strong Password:**  
`G#7dK!p2@Xz9Qw8L`

- **Test Result on PasswordMonster:** Very Strong
- **Feedback:** Excellent length and randomness, includes all character types, not found in dictionary databases.

---

### 8. Tips Learned from Evaluation (PasswordMonster Insights)

- Use at least 14 characters for strong security.
- Passphrases (sentences with spaces and punctuation) are highly effective.
- Avoid predictable substitutions (like "A" to "@")—hackers know these tricks.
- Never reuse passwords, even if they are strong.
- Don’t let browsers or spreadsheets store your passwords.
- Always enable MFA for important accounts.

## Conclusion

Through this exercise using PasswordMonster.com, I learned that password strength depends on length, complexity, and unpredictability. Using strong, unique passwords and passphrases is essential for protecting accounts against common cyber attacks. Regular evaluation and updating of passwords, along with the use of password managers and MFA, are key to maintaining good security hygiene.
