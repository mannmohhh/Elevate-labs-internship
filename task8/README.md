# Internship Task: VPN Hands-On Experience

## Overview

This project documents my hands-on experience with ProtonVPN as part of a cybersecurity internship. The goal was to understand VPN setup, privacy features, practical effects on browsing, and to audit browser extensions for security.

## Steps Performed

### 1. VPN Service Selection and Sign-Up
- Chose **ProtonVPN (Free Tier)** for its reputation and privacy features.
- Visited the ProtonVPN website and clicked “Get Proton VPN Free.”
- Created a Proton account (username, password, email).
- Verified the account via email with a 6-digit code.

### 2. VPN Client Installation
- Downloaded the ProtonVPN client for Windows.
- Installed the client and logged in using Proton credentials.

### 3. Connecting to a VPN Server
- Launched the ProtonVPN app.
- Selected a free server in **Japan**.
- Clicked “Connect” and waited for the status to show “Connected.”

### 4. IP Address Verification
- **Original IP (India):** `183.82.161.70`
- **VPN IP (Japan):** `212.102.51.112`
- Used [whatismyipaddress.com](https://www.whatismyipaddress.com) to verify the change.

### 5. Browsing and Speed Test
- Browsed YouTube at full quality after connecting to the VPN.
- Noticed a reduction in streaming speed and increased buffering, showing the impact of VPN routing and encryption.

### 6. Disconnect and Comparison
- Disconnected from the VPN.
- Verified that the IP reverted to the original Indian address.
- Browsing speed returned to normal.

### 7. VPN Encryption & Privacy Research
- ProtonVPN uses strong encryption protocols (OpenVPN, IKEv2/IPSec, WireGuard).
- All traffic is encrypted and tunneled, protecting data from interception.
- VPN masks the real IP, enhancing privacy, but does not guarantee complete anonymity.

### 8. Browser Extension Audit
- Reviewed installed browser extensions.
- Removed any suspicious or unused extensions to reduce privacy risks.

## VPN Benefits and Limitations

### Benefits
- Encrypts all internet traffic, protecting data from hackers and ISPs.
- Hides real IP address and geographic location.
- Bypasses geo-restrictions for content access.
- Secures public Wi-Fi connections.

### Limitations
- Free servers may be overloaded, causing speed reduction (as observed during YouTube streaming).
- VPN does not guarantee total anonymity; some tracking methods (like browser fingerprinting) still apply.
- Some websites may block VPN traffic.
- VPN provider could potentially log user activity (review privacy policy).

## Summary

This exercise provided practical experience with VPN setup, privacy verification, and understanding real-world limitations such as speed reduction. I also learned the importance of auditing browser extensions as part of personal cybersecurity hygiene.
